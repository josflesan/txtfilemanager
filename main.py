    \ncreatefile(filename, [directory]) : function creates a file from two arguments,
    both strings, the file name and the directory. Do not specify directory if
    you want to write file into current one. Add '..' at start of path if you
    would like to go up a directory. A custom error message will be outputted if 
    your file path was not found
    
    \ndeletefile(filename, [directory]) : function deletes file if found. Otherwise,
    a custom error message is outputted. Add '..' at start of path if you would like to
    go up a directory, or leave it blank if want to work in current
    
    \nencryptfile(filename, [directory]) : function which encrypts a text file based on
    _________ algorithm
    
    \ndecryptfile(filename, directory, key) : function which decrypts a text file based on
    __________ algorithm
    
    \nwriteline(filename, [directory, text, line_number]) : function which writes a line of text 
    into the file in the specified directory. Line_number will be an integer representing the index
    of the line we will like to modify, but will be taken as 0 if file is empty. Custom error
    outputted if IndexError raised
    
    \nappendline(filename, [directory, text]) : function which appends a line to a file in
    specified directory. Similar functionality to 'writeline'
    
    \nfindline(filename, [directory, text]) : function that returns all of the line numbers where
    the specified line of text was found in the file.
    
    \ndeleteline(filename, [directory, line_number]) : function which deletes a specified line number
    in the file.
    
    \nfindfile(filename) : function which searches for a specified file in the cwd and returns its 
    full path if it is found (as a string).
